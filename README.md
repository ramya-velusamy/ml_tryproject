# 🤖 Simple ML-Based Detection Project

This project is a beginner-friendly exploration into **Machine Learning-based detection** using camera input and file uploads. It was developed to understand the core workflow of how ML models process input data in real-time and through file uploads.

## 🎯 Project Objective

To gain hands-on experience in:
- Integrating ML models into a basic application.
- Handling both **live camera feeds** and **uploaded files** for detection.
- Understanding the input-output flow in ML-based applications.

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Understood how ML models take input from different sources (camera, file).
- Explored how detection models classify or identify objects/images.
- Learned to connect the frontend (camera/file upload interface) with a backend ML logic.
- Practiced basic concepts like image preprocessing, prediction, and result display.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python (for ML logic)
- OpenCV (for camera input handling)
- Flask / Streamlit (for simple interface – if used)
- Teachable Machine / TensorFlow/Keras (for model training or loading a pre-trained model)
- HTML + JavaScript (if used for the frontend)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. User can either **capture from a webcam** or **upload an image/video file**.
2. The input is passed to a **pre-trained ML model**.
3. The model performs detection/classification.
4. Results (like labels or bounding boxes) are displayed back to the user.

## 📂 Status

This project is an experimental prototype and was done solely for learning and exploration purposes.  
It helped lay the foundation for future, more advanced ML-based applications.
